#1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
# Escape characters represent characters in string values that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to type into code.
#In Python strings, the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special character with "\" turns it into an ordinary character.
